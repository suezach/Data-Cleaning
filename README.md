# DATA CLEANING VS DATA WRANGLING

Data Cleaning is removing inaccurate and inconsistent data.
Data Wrangling is transforming raw data into a more usuable format.

Any analyses a business performs will ulyimately be constrained by the data that informs them. If the data is incomplete, unreliable, or faulty, then analyses will be too.. thus diminishing the value of any critical insights gleaned.

Data Wrangling seeks to remove the risk by ensuring data is in a reliable state before it is analyzed and leveraged. This makes it a very critical part of an analytical process.
